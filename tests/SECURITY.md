## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the test suite, please follow these steps:

1. **Do Not** disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed.
2. Email the security team at security@webblycms.com with:
   - Subject: "Webbly CMS Test Suite Security Vulnerability"
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Any suggested fixes (if available)
3. You will receive an acknowledgment within 48 hours.
4. The security team will investigate and provide updates.
5. Once addressed, you will be notified and can verify the fix.

## Security Best Practices

### When Using the Test Suite

1. **Environment Isolation**
   - Always run tests in isolated environments
   - Never run security tests against production systems
   - Use dedicated test databases and services

2. **Credentials Management**
   - Never commit real credentials to the test suite
   - Use environment variables for sensitive data
   - Rotate test credentials regularly

3. **Data Protection**
   - Use generated or anonymized test data
   - Never use real user data in tests
   - Clean up sensitive test data after tests

4. **Access Control**
   - Restrict access to test environments
   - Use appropriate permissions for test users
   - Monitor test environment access

### When Contributing

1. **Code Review**
   - Review security implications of changes
   - Check for potential vulnerabilities
   - Validate input handling
   - Verify error handling

2. **Dependencies**
   - Keep dependencies up to date
   - Review security advisories
   - Use trusted sources
   - Lock dependency versions

3. **Documentation**
   - Document security considerations
   - Include security warnings
   - Update security guidelines
