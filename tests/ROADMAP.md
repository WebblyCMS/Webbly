## Feature Details

### Test Coverage Improvements

#### Unit Test Expansion
```python
# Example of new test pattern
@pytest.mark.unit
class TestFeature:
    """Comprehensive unit test suite."""
    
    def test_success_case(self):
        pass
    
    def test_error_cases(self):
        pass
    
    def test_edge_cases(self):
        pass
```

#### Integration Test Enhancement
```python
# Example of integration test improvement
@pytest.mark.integration
class TestServiceIntegration:
    """Enhanced integration testing."""
    
    async def test_service_interaction(self):
        pass
    
    async def test_error_handling(self):
        pass
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Parallel Execution
```python
# Example of parallel test configuration
pytest_config = {
    'parallel_mode': 'processes',
    'process_count': 4,
    'group_size': 10
}
```

#### Resource Management
```python
# Example of optimized resource handling
@pytest.fixture(scope='session')
def optimized_resource():
    """Efficient resource management."""
    resource = setup_resource()
    yield resource
    cleanup_resource(resource)
```
