# Test Review Guide

## Overview

This guide provides a structured approach to reviewing test code in the Webbly CMS test suite. It helps ensure consistency, quality, and maintainability of tests.

## Review Process

### 1. Initial Assessment

#### Documentation Review
- [ ] Test purpose is clearly documented
- [ ] Requirements are referenced
- [ ] Edge cases are documented
- [ ] Assumptions are stated
- [ ] Dependencies are listed

#### Code Organization
```python
# Good organization
class TestUserAuthentication:
    """Tests for user authentication."""
    
    def test_login_success(self):
        """Test successful login."""
        pass
    
    def test_login_failure(self):
        """Test failed login."""
        pass
```

### 2. Code Quality Review

#### Test Structure
```python
# Good structure
def test_feature():
    """Test feature description."""
    # Arrange
    test_data = prepare_test_data()
    
    # Act
    result = feature_under_test(test_data)
    
    # Assert
    assert result.is_valid
    assert result.status == 'success'
```

#### Common Issues to Check
```python
# Bad: Hidden dependencies
def test_with_global():
    global_data.setup()  # Avoid global state
    
# Good: Explicit dependencies
def test_with_fixture(test_data):
    result = process(test_data)
```

### 3. Test Coverage Analysis

#### Coverage Requirements
- [ ] Critical paths covered
- [ ] Edge cases tested
- [ ] Error conditions verified
- [ ] Integration points tested
- [ ] Security scenarios covered

#### Coverage Report Review
```bash
# Generate coverage report
pytest --cov=webbly --cov-report=html
```

### 4. Performance Review

#### Performance Criteria
- [ ] Tests execute quickly
- [ ] Resources properly managed
- [ ] No unnecessary operations
- [ ] Efficient data setup
- [ ] Proper cleanup

#### Performance Issues
```python
# Bad: Inefficient setup
def test_inefficient():
    for _ in range(1000):
        create_test_data()  # Expensive operation
        
# Good: Efficient setup
@pytest.fixture(scope='module')
def test_data():
    return create_test_data()
```

### 5. Security Review

#### Security Considerations
- [ ] No sensitive data exposed
- [ ] Secure test data used
- [ ] Authentication tested
- [ ] Authorization verified
- [ ] Input validation tested

#### Security Testing
```python
def test_security():
    """Test security measures."""
    with pytest.raises(SecurityError):
        access_protected_resource(invalid_token)
```

## Feedback Guidelines

### Constructive Feedback
```python
# Instead of:
# "This test is bad"

# Say:
# "Consider restructuring this test to follow the AAA pattern:
def test_feature():
    # Arrange
    data = prepare_data()
    
    # Act
    result = process(data)
    
    # Assert
    assert result.is_valid"
```

### Common Feedback Points

#### 1. Test Structure
```python
# Suggest improvements like:
def test_improved():
    """Clear purpose and structure."""
    # Arrange
    user = create_test_user()
    
    # Act
    result = user.perform_action()
    
    # Assert
    assert_valid_result(result)
```

#### 2. Error Handling
```python
# Suggest proper error handling:
def test_error_handling():
    """Proper error handling example."""
    with pytest.raises(ValueError) as exc_info:
        process_invalid_input()
    assert str(exc_info.value) == 'Expected error'
```

#### 3. Resource Management
```python
# Suggest proper cleanup:
@pytest.fixture
def managed_resource():
    """Resource with proper cleanup."""
    resource = setup_resource()
    yield resource
    cleanup_resource(resource)
```

## Common Review Scenarios

### 1. Missing Coverage
```python
# Suggest additional test cases:
def test_edge_case():

def test_error_condition():
    """Test error handling."""
    pass
```

# Suggest better organization:
class TestFeature:
    """Group related tests."""
    
    def test_success(self):
        """Test success case."""
        pass
    
    def test_failure(self):
        """Test failure case."""
        pass
```

### 3. Performance Issues
```python
# Suggest performance improvements:
@pytest.fixture(scope='module')
def expensive_resource():
    """Reuse expensive resource."""
    return setup_expensive_resource()
```
