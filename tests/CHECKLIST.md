## Notes

1. Use this checklist as a guide, not a constraint
2. Adapt to project-specific needs
3. Update regularly based on lessons learned
4. Share improvements with team
5. Automate checks where possible

Remember: Quality over quantity. Well-written tests are more valuable than many poor tests.
