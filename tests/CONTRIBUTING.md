## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork
3. Set up the test environment:
   ```bash
   cd tests
   make init
   ```
4. Create a new branch for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Test Structure

Tests are organized into the following categories:

- `unit/`: Unit tests for individual components
- `integration/`: Integration tests between components
- `functional/`: End-to-end functional tests
- `performance/`: Performance and load tests
- `security/`: Security and vulnerability tests

Each category has its own set of fixtures and utilities in the `fixtures/` directory.

## Writing Tests

### Test File Naming

- Test files should be named `test_*.py`
- Name should clearly indicate what is being tested
- Use lowercase with underscores

### Test Function Naming

- Test functions should be named `test_*`
- Name should clearly describe the test case
- Include success and failure cases

### Example Test Structure

```python
"""Test module docstring describing the test category."""

import pytest
from tests.fixtures import (
    assert_valid_response,
    data_generator,
    requires_login
)

@pytest.mark.unit
def test_function_success():
    """Test successful case."""
    # Arrange
    data = data_generator.generate_test_data()
    
    # Act
    result = function_under_test(data)
    
    # Assert
    assert result is not None
    assert_valid_response(result)

@pytest.mark.unit
def test_function_failure():
    """Test failure case."""
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        function_under_test(invalid_data)
```

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests
- Test individual components in isolation
- Mock dependencies
- Focus on edge cases
- Quick to run

### Integration Tests
- Test component interactions
- Use test databases
- Test service integration
- Include rollback scenarios

### Functional Tests
- Test complete features
- End-to-end scenarios
- User workflow testing
- Browser automation

### Performance Tests
- Load testing
- Stress testing
- Benchmarking
- Resource monitoring

### Security Tests
- Vulnerability scanning
- Input validation
- Authentication/Authorization
- Data protection

## Best Practices

1. **Isolation**
   - Tests should be independent
   - Clean up after tests
   - Don't rely on test order

2. **Clarity**
   - Clear test names
   - Descriptive docstrings
   - Well-organized assertions

3. **Maintenance**
   - Keep tests simple
   - Avoid test duplication
   - Use shared fixtures

4. **Performance**
   - Fast unit tests
   - Parallel test execution
   - Appropriate timeouts

5. **Coverage**
   - High test coverage
   - Important edge cases
   - Error scenarios

## Code Style

Follow these style guidelines:

1. **PEP 8**
   - Use black for formatting
   - Run flake8 for linting
   - Follow import order

2. **Documentation**
   - Module docstrings
   - Function docstrings
   - Clear comments

3. **Naming**
   - Descriptive names
   - Consistent conventions
   - Clear abbreviations

4. **Organization**
   - Logical grouping
   - Clear hierarchy
   - Consistent structure
